I am a senior at UC Berkeley in my final semester double majoring in physics and philosophy and minoring in mathematics. My research interests generally lie at the intersections of quantum information science with high energy physics, in both theory and experiment.

I am currently a student research employee at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory working with Dr. Daniel Carney in the [Quantum Measurements Group](https://quantum-measurement.lbl.gov/). Most recently, I have been engaged in a theoretical honors bachelor's thesis on quantum measurements in holography, with the co-supervision of Prof. Luca Iliesiu and Prof. Geoff Penington. Part of this work will involve simulating a quantum information scrambling on superconducting qutrits in collaboration with the [Advanced Quantum Testbed](https://aqt.lbl.gov/). Previously, I performed particle physics simulations for the upcoming quantum sensing experiment [QuIPS (Quantum Invisible Particle Sensor)](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.010315).

Prior to transferring to Berkeley, I took a gap year to conduct axion dark matter research full time at Fermilab and UChicago on the [Broadband Reflector Experiment for Axion Detection (BREAD)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.171002).
